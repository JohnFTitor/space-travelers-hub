# Space Travelers' Hub

> This is a React-Redux-based project, built with pair programming and Gitflow, following [this kanban workflow](https://github.com/JohnFTitor/space-travelers-hub/projects/1). The page has a global state that holds the Rockets and missions from the SpaceX API and allows you to reserve them, displaying on your profile section the missions that you own.

![Preview](./preview.gif)

Take a view on the SpaceX rockets and missions, reserve them, and have a register of what you reserved for yourself in your profile! The page will render dynamically in your profile when you reserve or cancel the missions and rockets from the oficial spaceX API
